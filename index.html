        When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation
        coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only
        family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street
        seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet
        top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
        After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them
        out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
        green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple
        coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away
        without a word.  e weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed
        to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

        There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal
        of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
