            When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation
            coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only
            family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street
            seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet
            top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.
            After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them
            out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
            green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple
            coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away
            without a word. e weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed
            to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

            There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal
            of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
